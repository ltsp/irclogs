# IRC logs

We want to move irclogs.ltsp.org here, as follows:

- The ltsp supybot (limnoria) will be keeping daily logs,
- And it will be committing them in this repository every 5-10 minutes,
- At which point a Jekyll script will be converting them into an indexed site.

If anyone knows Jekyll and can help with this... ping!
