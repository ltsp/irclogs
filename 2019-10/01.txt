2019-10-01T10:58:01  <matusiak> Hi everyone. Is there a way i LTSP to create many accounts and assign them to epoptes, for users (students)? At the beginning of school I want to create account for every student in my class. So I have my first class with 5-th graders and there is 16 of them. So I run a script? Or something and I quickly create 16 accounts with epoptes assign to them. Then I tell them to login with credentials like class6-01, class6-02 â€¦ , class6-16 and I show the
2019-10-01T10:58:01  <matusiak> m how to change password.
2019-10-01T10:58:11  <matusiak> You know about something like this? How do you create accounts for your users or students in LTPS?
2019-10-01T10:59:26  <meo> matusiak: you should be trivially able to create accounts with standard tools
2019-10-01T10:59:54  <meo> adduser(1) will do 99% of what you want
2019-10-01T11:00:26  <meo> of course it's done with a shell script
2019-10-01T11:01:03  <meo> your script would read a list of usernames and full names, call adduser for each one, then generate a password
2019-10-01T11:02:17  <meo> oh I forgot there's also newusers(1)
2019-10-01T11:02:26  <meo> https://www.2daygeek.com/linux-bulk-users-creation-useradd-newusers/
2019-10-01T11:06:01  <matusiak> oh! that's grate. I think that is what I was looking for. As I can see from the link above I can also specify users in text file. Thanks for the link. I will try this methods.
2019-10-01T11:06:34  <meo> you are welcome
2019-10-01T11:06:45  <meo> dont forget you need to regenerate the images after you create the users
2019-10-01T11:07:39  <matusiak> right, thx

2019-10-01T14:01:27  <gp> alkisg: What was hanging me up yesterday is how to configure xinit.  I was able to get xterm working with simple case of startx but I cannot seem to call anything correctly with xinit.  Do you happen to know the analogous command for the freerdp screen script from LTSP5 for the systemd unit? exec xinit /usr/share/ltsp/xinitrc "$COMMAND" -- "$DISPLAY" "vt${TTY}" -nolisten tcp $X_ARGS >/dev/null
2019-10-01T14:02:31  <alkisg> gp, no I haven't looked into it recently
2019-10-01T14:02:43  <gp> alkisg: Ok. I will keep tinkering.
2019-10-01T14:02:53  <alkisg> gp, are you sure it's best to use multiple vts instead of 1?
2019-10-01T14:03:16  <alkisg> E.g. one user might be working on rdp on vt6, and another on lightdm on vt7? how does that work?
2019-10-01T14:03:22  <alkisg> Why not use multiple session instead?
2019-10-01T14:08:08  <gp> alkisg: I am not very familiar with this yet but I do not understand what you mean. I have been trying to set the SCREEN to work when a virtual console is swapped to with cntrl alt #.  Here are some of the tries but you can probably tell from the paste I am still trying to figure out what I am doing
2019-10-01T14:08:09  <gp> http://paste.debian.net/1103491/
2019-10-01T14:08:28  <gp> the startx is the only one that has worked so far.
2019-10-01T14:09:34  <alkisg> gp, I mean this: what are you currently using SCREENs for?
2019-10-01T14:09:41  <alkisg> Normal login, xfreerdp, ssh, right?
2019-10-01T14:09:57  <alkisg> Do different people use those at the same time? Usually nope.
2019-10-01T14:10:16  <alkisg> So why don't you let your users login as usual, and THEN run rdp or ssh or whatever?
2019-10-01T14:10:39  <alkisg> If a user only needs to run xfreerdp, it can be the only program that a session runs
2019-10-01T14:18:18  <gp> alkisg: Yes they use them simulatenously
2019-10-01T14:18:41  <gp> alkisg: oops sorry no. not different users
2019-10-01T14:18:43  <alkisg> gp, how? You have 2 keyboards?
2019-10-01T14:18:54  <alkisg> Right, so if it's only one user, where do vts benefit?
2019-10-01T14:19:12  <alkisg> Only the old ltsp used those
2019-10-01T14:19:29  <alkisg> Normal installations don't really use them
2019-10-01T14:19:31  <gp> alkisg: because you can run the linux desktop and the freerdp terminal at the same time. I was just trying to do it the same for motor skills
2019-10-01T14:20:24  <gp> alkisg: you suggest using a different session for the display manager to log in to?
2019-10-01T14:20:42  <alkisg> Yes, or just use 2 windows
2019-10-01T14:20:50  <alkisg> One for rdp, and switch with the mouse like usual
2019-10-01T14:22:13  <gp> alkisg: the freerdp connects as if you were physicaly plugged into the rdp computer. but that can be worked out differently.  the screens approach is a better fix but if it is more complicated perhaps I can get going like you suggest until I can work out the screens
2019-10-01T14:22:36  <gp> alkisg: will try to put together a wiki entry for it once i do. I thought it was a popular option because it works so well. maybe not
2019-10-01T14:24:51  <alkisg> gp, I implemented a lot of this stuff, and I ended up never using them
2019-10-01T14:27:21  <alkisg> One can set up an xfreerdp session, that automatically connects full screen after lightdm
2019-10-01T14:27:43  <alkisg> Or they can set up multiple windows with ssh, rdp, whatever, and handle them as real windows, instead of having to switch VTs,
2019-10-01T14:27:54  <alkisg> plus, most of this stuff won't work on wayland anyway
2019-10-01T14:28:14  <gp> alkisg: My personal use of the screens was for having linux booted as a programming terminal. and being able to hit control alt f5 to open up the freerdp so I could give tech support. But both vts kept current progress so i could swap without effecting the other
2019-10-01T14:28:22  <gp> I will try the lightdm session
2019-10-01T14:28:36  <gp> It was my understanding before that lightdm couldn't allow two concurrent sessions
2019-10-01T14:28:48  <alkisg> That's where workspaces help
2019-10-01T14:28:59  <alkisg> You have one workspace for programming, another for remote support etc
2019-10-01T14:29:17  <alkisg> And they're all in the same wayland/xorg session, so clipboard works too, etc etc
2019-10-01T14:29:48  <alkisg> If multiple VTs were something people needed a lot... systemd/xorg/wayland/DMs would make it easy for them
2019-10-01T14:30:06  <alkisg> They don't; and ltsp ended up needing a lot of hacks and introducing a lot of race conditions
2019-10-01T14:30:31  <alkisg> For example, in some debian versions people had to switch to vt1, then vt7, for lightdm to load, because of screen race conditions
2019-10-01T14:30:46  <alkisg> lightdm does support multiple concurrent sessions though
2019-10-01T14:30:51  <alkisg> But only for different users
2019-10-01T14:31:00  <alkisg> It's the "login as ..." feature in the menu
2019-10-01T14:32:22  <gp> alkisg: understood. I don't think it gives the same flexibility but if it is good enough and simpler without race conditions that is a win
2019-10-01T14:32:31  <gp> will give that a try first
2019-10-01T14:32:44  <alkisg> gp, you can also do this:
2019-10-01T14:33:09  <alkisg> run xinit etc from inside your session, and launch a second xorg just for xfreerdp,
2019-10-01T14:33:16  <alkisg> without relying on ltsp or anything else to do that
2019-10-01T14:34:19  <alkisg> I.e. just make a `run-on-another-vt <program>` script
2019-10-01T14:35:00  <gp> alkisg: I think that sounds like a straightfoward approach. Thanks =)
2019-10-01T14:35:04  <alkisg> np
2019-10-01T14:35:28  <alkisg> It'll probably won't work on wayland, but for a few years it should be ok
2019-10-01T14:37:01  <gp> enough time to get comfortable with something else =)
2019-10-01T14:39:18  <gp> alkisg: So here is one that I am confused about with removing screens cripts. Before, I could set the client to clear all screens and only allow "kiosk" for a public email checking terminal.  How would you do something like that with the new setup?
2019-10-01T14:39:25  <gp> alkisg: Have to have a different image?
2019-10-01T14:41:02  <alkisg> You'd autologin to a different session
2019-10-01T14:41:24  <alkisg> E.g. /usr/share/xessions/kiosk.desktop
2019-10-01T14:41:27  <alkisg> *xsessions
2019-10-01T14:42:52  <gp> alkisg: thanks for the chat. take me a minute to change my mindset but the direction makes sense
